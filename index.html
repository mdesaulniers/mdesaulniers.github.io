<h1> Welcome To My Web Page! </h1>

        <p> Hello to whoever has stumbled onto my first Webpage. The purpose of this site is for me to practice my coding ability <br>
            in a practical sense by creating a fully functioning Website. As of right now, the site is lacking a lot, such as,    <br>
            various asthetic features, a deeply interactive interface, and content in general. However, as I work to increase     <br>
            my coding knowledge I will be religiously updating this site until I am happy with the finalized product. Though it   <br>
            may be a long and difficult task, I will continue to put in daily work on my website, and in honing my own skills, in <br>
            order to further both over time. </p>
