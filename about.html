        <p> Hello, my name is Mike Desaulniers, I am a Sophomore student at the University of Rhode Island and am currently <br>
            studying computer science, with hopes to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I am originally from Waterbury, Connecticut <br>
            but decided to study here at URI because I like the state of Rhode Island and URI has a phenomenal business program, <br>
            which I was previously studying. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing sports, working out and <br>
            playing video games.</p>
